# Notes-App
 This is a basic Notes App created using react native and expo-cli . This project was made as a part of ISOC (IEEE Summer of Code ) . I am thankful to IEEE-VIT for giving me this opportunity and my mentor ,Sarthak Pranesh for helping me out with this project .
## Reasons for chosing expo-cli
- It's beginner friendly
- No need of Android studio or XCode , You can run the app simultaneously while working on it 
- Sharing the app is easy
- The Expo sdk offers a collection of ready solutions
